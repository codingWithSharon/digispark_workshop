Learn to automate keystrokes, inject scripts, and build USB-based payloads with Digispark.

## What is Digispark?

Digispark is a tiny, USB-powered microcontroller based on the ATtiny85 chip. It can emulate a keyboard or mouse (HID device), making it ideal for automating tasks on a computer—especially when plugged in directly via USB.

The Digispark may be tiny, but in the world of pentesting, it’s a surprisingly powerful ally—especially for physical access attacks and automated payload delivery.

- HID Attacks (Human Interface Device)
- Payload Injection
- Social Engineering Tools
- Automation for Recon & Exploits

## ETHICAL reminder

These tools are powerful, but they must be used responsibly and legally. In pentesting, Digispark shines when:

- You have authorized access
- You’re testing physical security
- You’re simulating real-world attack vectors

Besides pentesting the Digispark is a good way to way to automate tasks and to get familiar with hotkeys and the terminal.
